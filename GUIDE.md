## [Authlocal.org](https://authlocal.org/) Frequently Asked Questions

### Zero-cost at worldwide scale? How is it technically possible!?
- [Authlocal.org](https://authlocal.org/) is a 100% static http deployment. Dirt cheap to host.
- No api servers or microservices or anything like that.
- It's a clientside app, where users manage identities, and it operates via clientside postMessage.
- And it's open source, which means GitHub Pages is willing to host it for free.

### Who are we really trusting with the user's identity keys?
- Your web browser.
- GitHub and GitHub Pages, which hosts the source and app for free.
