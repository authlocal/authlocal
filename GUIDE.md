> ***Developers,*** also see the technical [README.md](README.md)

Go to https://authlocal.org/ to manage your identities.

ðŸ—½ **User-sovereign** â€“ you own your identity  
ðŸ”‘ **Cryptographic** â€“ no emails, no passwords  
ðŸ¥· **Privacy-focused** â€“ device-local, no databases  
ðŸ¥ž **Easy as pancakes** â€“ login with two clicks  
ðŸ’– **Free and open-source** â€“ zero-cost at global scale  

### You hold the keys

Authlocal stores identities *locally* in your web browser, on your device.

You must keep your keys safe, because some web browsers have a habit of unexpectedly wiping your web storage *(Safari, we see you).*

### Any third-party website can request your login from https://authlocal.org/

You can approve login requests in the Authlocal popup. Third-party websites *never* see your seed.

## ðŸ¤” Authlocal FAQ

### What if I lose my identity file or seed?
- It's gone. Generate a new one.
- If an app ties important goods or services to your identity, they should provide a recovery mechanism.

### How do I recover my identity from a seed?
- You can download your seeds, or copy-paste them yourself.
- Transfer the seed to your new device any way you want.
- Go to https://authlocal.org/ and click the `Import` button. You can upload a seed file, or paste one in.
- This is also how you move identities between your devices.

### Somebody, or some website, asked for my seed?
- It's a scam! Never share your seed with anybody anywhere except https://authlocal.org/

### What's with the weird names like "`dozmut.winpex.linner`"?
- That's a *sigil*, the shorthand for an identity's cryptographic thumbprint.
- Thumbprint: "`dozmut.winpex.linner::2Y3rjac1sCaAAbhThwvshr2Rs3X4HxGMjMF2`"
  - The full and precise way to identify somebody.
  - There are more possible thumbprints than atoms in the entire galaxy. And there are a quintillion atoms in a grain of sand... I mean, think about that for awhile.. That's a lot of atoms.
- Sigil: "`dozmut.winpex.linner`"
  - It's just an 8-byte preview of the thumbprint.

### Can I change the color associated with my identity?
- No. It's derived from the identity's cryptographic thumbprint.

### What does "Persistence off" mean?
- It means your browser might delete your identities from authlocal.org any time.
- Conversely, "Persistence on" means the browser pinky-swears to keep your identities safe.
- If you click "Persistence off", Authlocal will request persistence. Firefox will nicely ask your permission. Chrome and Safari will usually ignore you.
- On Safari, with persistence off, there is a 7-day inactive data deletion policy, so Safari users often need to re-import their identities.

### Zero-cost at global scale? How is it technically possible!?
- [Authlocal.org](https://authlocal.org/) is a static http deployment. Dirt cheap hosting.
- No api servers or microservices. Runs clientside, using postMessage.
- It's open source, so GitHub Pages is willing to host it for free.

### How many people are using Authlocal?
- We don't know.
- We don't collect data or track analytics.
- Star this project on GitHub to give us a clue.

### What vectors threaten my keys on [authlocal.org](https://authlocal.org/)?
- Yourself.
- Your web browser, operating system, and hardware.
- GitHub and GitHub Pages, which hosts the source and app for free.
  - They surely record their own pageview analytics, and a compromised Microsoft could inject a trojan to steal keys on authlocal.org.
  - In the future, we may need to secure funding to host Authlocal on its own security hardened servers.
