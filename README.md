üîë **Elliptic** ‚Äì identities are [`@noble/ed25519`](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-ed25519) keypairs  
üèõÔ∏è **Federated** ‚Äì your app gets user logins from [authlocal.org](https://authlocal.org/) popup  
üì± **Clientside** ‚Äì statically deployed, no api servers  
üìú **Protocol** ‚Äì permissionless integration, you can do it your way  
ü•ß **Easy as pie** ‚Äì setup your app with an easy snippet  

### A cryptographic login system for the world wide web
Authlocal can provide free auth for everybody.

### A free login system for your website
- Try out the example integration live demo here: https://authlocal.org/federated/
- Your users click "Login", pick an identity, then *boom!* ‚Äî they're logged into your site.
- Next, you can use claim tokens, for your server to verify user requests.
- And all this costs you nothing.

### What

<br/>

## Authlocal installation and setup

### Quick start
1. Pick one of these install techniques
    1. **HTML install technique**  
        Put this into your html `<head>`:
        ```html
        <script type="module">
          import {Auth} from "https://authlocal.org/install.bundle.min.js"
          const auth = await Auth.install()

          // Handle user logins and logouts
          auth.on(login => {
            if (login) console.log("logged in", login.label)
            else console.log("logged out")
          })
        </script>
        ```
    1. **Webdev install technique**  
        Install the package into your npm project:
        ```sh
        npm install @authlocal/authlocal
        ```
        Write this in your app's js entrypoint (like `main.ts`):
        ```ts
        import {Auth} from "@authlocal/authlocal"
        const auth = await Auth.install()

        // Handle user logins and logouts
        auth.on(login => {
          if (login) console.log("logged in", login.label)
          else console.log("logged out")
        })
        ```
1. Place the UI elements into your html `<body>`:
    ```html
    <auth-user></auth-user>
    <auth-button></auth-button>
    ```
1. It's ready, take it for a spin!
     - You should now be able to login, and logout

### More about CSS themes
- See that `e280.css.js` theme in the install snippet? You can swap it out!
  - `basic.css.js` ‚Äî simple high-contrast theme
  - `e280.css.js` ‚Äî neon buildercore aesthetic
- You can actually omit the theme, and it will look all browser-defaulty and ugly:
  ```ts
  const auth = await Auth.install()
  ```
- If you must, you can put on your mud boots and write your own custom css like this:
  ```ts
  import {Auth, css} from "@authlocal/authlocal"
  import theme from "@authlocal/authlocal/x/themes/basic.css.js"

  const auth = await Auth.install({theme: css`

    /* You can extend one of the preset themes */
    ${theme}

    /* Just write your own CSS as you wish */
    button { color: red; }
  `})
  ```

### Anatomy of a `login`
- **`login.id` unique id for a user**
  > eg, `"a08263e70a0a48a07e988a7c0931ada6b0a38fa84bf367087b810c614a4c2070"`  
  > *(it's actually the user identity public key)*
- **`login.label` ‚Äî user's chosen nickname**
  > eg, `"Michael Scott"`

<br/>

## Authlocal claims

#### Okay, so you have a user's `login`. Now what?
- The purpose of a login is to *sign claims* on the user's behalf.
- You must *never* send the login data anywhere. It should stay on the user's clientside device.
- The login is automatically persisted in `localStorage`.

#### The purpose of a claim is to say *"on behalf of this user, my frontend says..."*
- "...they want to post this message"
- "...they want to change their avatar"
- "...they want to buy this microtransaction"

#### Claims are secured cryptographically.
- Claims contain cryptographic proof that they stem from a user's login.
- No attacker can spoof a claim for somebody else's identity.

### Sign a claim
```js
import {future} from "@authlocal/authlocal"

const claimToken = await login.signClaim({

  // any json-friendly data you want
  claim: {message: "i love ice cream"},

  // when should this claim expire?
  expiresAt: future.hours(24),
})
```

### Verify a claim
```js
import {verifyClaim} from "@authlocal/authlocal"

const {claim, proof} = await verifyClaim({
  claimToken,
  appOrigins: ["https://example.e280.org"],
})

proof.sessionId
  // id for this login session, looks like:
  // "ff730fe2d725aa5210152975212d1068d7fe28ae22b5e62337a4cde42215187a"

proof.nametag.id
  // user identity id, looks like:
  // "a08263e70a0a48a07e988a7c0931ada6b0a38fa84bf367087b810c614a4c2070"

proof.nametag.label
  // user identity nickname, looks like:
  // "Michael Scott"
```
- You can verify claims on the clientside or serverside.
- You must specify what `appOrigins` you expect to receive claims from (this prevents phishing attacks).

## Strategies for user-sovereign auth

### Users will lose their identities, have a recovery plan

When you sell a service or digital good to a user's Authlocal identity, you'll need to have a recovery mechanism, or people will get cranky.

It may be wise to sell the digital goods to an email address, which can be used for recovery (simply resetting which Authlocal id owns the goods in your database). This would be a case where you are allowing the user to trade some privacy (email address, payment method) to afford this recovery safety.

## üíñ [Authlocal](https://authlocal.org/) is free and open source

My name is Chase Moskal, and I built Authlocal because I wanted free user-centric auth to power [benevolent.games](http://benevolent.games/).

Got questions or feedback? Don't hesitate to open a github issue or discussion anytime.

Like the project? Star it on github, it's the only way I'm paid.

Authlocal is associated with my project [e280.org](https://e280.org/), the buildercore collective.
