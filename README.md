# üõ°Ô∏è [Authlocal.org](https://authlocal.org/) ‚Äì User-sovereign Logins For All

[Authlocal.org](https://authlocal.org/) is an app where users can create and manage digital login passports.

You can add a *"Login with Authlocal"* button to your website, allowing users to login using an Authlocal passport.

‚ú® **No emails** ‚Äì users can remain anonymous  
üîë **No passwords** ‚Äì passports are cryptographic keypairs  
üóø **No databases** ‚Äì everything is stored locally on the user's device  

üóΩ **User-sovereign** ‚Äì users can directly download their passport files  
ü•∑ **Privacy-focused** ‚Äì no tracking, except for whatever github pages does  
üíñ **Free and open-source** ‚Äì zero cost at worldwide scale  

üì± **Clientside** ‚Äì statically hosted on github pages, no api servers  
üèõÔ∏è **Federated** ‚Äì your app can get login tokens from an authlocal.org popup  
üìú **Protocol** ‚Äì permissionless integration, you can do it your way  

ü•ß **Easy as pie** ‚Äì setup your app with an easy snippet  
ü•û **Easy as pancakes** ‚Äì logins are fast and painless for users  

> ***Pre-release:** Authlocal is an unfinished prototype, use at your own risk.*

### üòé Easy HTML Installation

*Choose this installation method if you don't know any better.*

1. **Insert this in your `<head>`:**
    ```html
    <script type="module" src="https://authlocal.org/install.bundle.min.js"></script>

    <script type="module">
      document.querySelector("auth-button").auth.onChange(login => {
        if (login) console.log("logged in", login)
        else console.log("logged out")
      })
    </script>
    ```
    - Customize that second script to handle logins/logouts your way.
    - When the user logs in, the `login` object looks like this:
      ```js
      login.name // Cetdok Pizafoaba
      login.thumbprint // "0d196fc3..."
      login.expiry // 1731740481065
      ```
    - When the user logs out, `login` is `null`.
1. **Put these elements in your `<body>`:**
    ```html
    <auth-user></auth-user>
    <auth-button></auth-button>
    ```
    - This provides a nice little status/button ui for users to login or logout.
    - The login state is automatically stored in `localStorage`.

### üßê Sophisticated Installation for App Devs

*Choose this installation method if you're familiar with npm, package.json, typescript ‚Äì stuff like that.*

1. **Install the npm package**
    ```sh
    npm i @authlocal/authlocal
    ```
1. **Register components and listen for auth changes.** `main.ts`
    ```ts
    import {Auth, components, register_to_dom} from "@authlocal/authlocal"

    register_to_dom(components)

    const auth = Auth.get()

    auth.onChange(login => {
      if (login) console.log("logged in", login)
      else console.log("logged out")
    })
    ```
1. **Throw down some elements.** `index.html`
    ```html
    <auth-user></auth-user>
    <auth-button></auth-button>
    ```

## üíÅ [Authlocal.org](https://authlocal.org/) is for convenience, not vendor lock-in
- You can fork Authlocal to make your own passport management app, and users can take their passport files there instead
- You can point the login button to your own fork:
  ```html
  <auth-button src="https://authlocal.org/"></auth-button>
  ```
  - Just swap `https://authlocal.org/` with your own url
  - This is what "decentralized", "user-sovereign", and "protocol" is all about

## üå† The More You Know, about [Authlocal.org](https://authlocal.org/)

### What if my users lose their passports?
- They'll just generate new passports.
- If you associate important services to your users' passports, you should provide a recovery mechanism so users can re-associate those services with new passports.

### Opt-in services for casual user experience
- While Authlocal's core must stay lean to retain user-sovereignty and privacy, we can still build optional services which allow users to trade a little sovereignty for some conveniences:
  - Username and password logins
  - Email-based recovery
  - OTP/QR codes to easily transfer passports across devices
  - Two-factor auth

<br/>

## üõ†Ô∏è More advanced integration examples

### Programmatically trigger a login
- You can use `auth.popup` to trigger a login, but you should do this in reaction to a user input event, otherwise the browser will block the popup.
  ```js
  import {auth} from "@authlocal/authlocal"

  myButton.onclick = async() => {
    const login = await auth.popup("https://authlocal.org/")
    if (login) console.log("logged in", login)
  }
  ```

### Understanding the Authlocal flow and tokens

![](https://i.imgur.com/w7P0cqy.png)

- When a user on your app clicks to login, this opens an Authlocal.org popup for them to login.
- The authlocal signs some tokens with your user's passport keypair, and sends them back to your application.
- Your app receives a `Login` object, which has some useful things:
  - `login.proof.token` -- this is a `Proof` token and it's public, so you can send it around anywhere so your user can prove their identity
  - `login.keys.signClaimToken(~)` -- you can use this to sign arbitrary data into a token, which is verifiably signed on behalf of the user's passport

#### Example of signing and verifying claim tokens

- **Sign a fresh claim token.**
  ```js
  import {Future} from "@authlocal/authlocal"

  const idToken = await login.keys.signClaimToken({
    expiresAt: Future.hours(24),

    // you can pack any abitrary data you want into this token
    data: {
      username: "Rec Doamge",
      avatarId: "d15aea1a",

      // perhaps we want to scope this claim to a specific game session,
      // so that it cannot be stolen by other users and reused in other
      // game sessions.
      gameSessionId: "9c22b17e",
    },
  })
  ```
- **Send this *idToken* along with the user's *proofToken.***
  ```js
  await sendElsewhere(login.proof.token, idToken)
  ```
  - Each `login` object comes with a proof token that is required to verify any claim tokens.
- **Verify the proof and claim**
  ```js
  import {Proof, Claim} from "@authlocal/authlocal"

  receiveElsewhere(async(proofToken, idToken) => {

    // the origin of your site that triggered the authlocal popup
    const allowedAudiences = ["https://example.benev.gg"]

    // verifying the proof
    const proof = await Proof.verify(proofToken, {allowedAudiences})

    // proving the claim
    const claim = await Claim.verify(proof, idToken)

    // here's that data you packed into the claim
    console.log(claim.data.username) // "Rec Doamge"
    console.log(claim.data.avatarId) // "d15aea1a"
    console.log(claim.data.gameSessionId) // "9c22b17e"

    // user passport public thumbprint, the true user identifier
    console.log(claim.thumbprint) // "a32e638e..."
    console.log(proof.thumbprint) // "a32e638e..."
  })
  ```
  - The same proof can be used to verify multiple claims from the same login.
