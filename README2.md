üèõÔ∏è **Federated** ‚Äì your app gets user logins from [authlocal.org](https://authlocal.org/) popup  
üì± **Clientside** ‚Äì statically deployed, no api servers  
üìú **Protocol** ‚Äì permissionless integration, you can do it your way  
ü•ß **Easy as pie** ‚Äì setup your app with an easy snippet  

### Authlocal is a free login system for your website!
- Try out the example integration live demo here: https://authlocal.org/federated/
- Your users click "Login", pick an identity, then *boom!* ‚Äî they're logged into your site.
- Next, you can use claim tokens, for your server to verify user requests.
- And all this costs you nothing.

## Authlocal installation and setup

### Quick start
1. Pick one of these install techniques
    1. **HTML install technique**  
        Put this into your html `<head>`:
        ```html
        <script type="module">
          import Auth from "https://authlocal.org/install.bundle.min.js"
          import theme from "https://authlocal.org/themes/e280.css.js"

          const auth = await Auth.install({theme})

          // Handle user logins and logouts
          auth.on(login => {
            if (login) console.log("login", login.label)
            else console.log("logout")
          })
        </script>
        ```
    1. **Webdev install technique**  
        Install the package into your npm project:
        ```sh
        npm install @authlocal/authlocal
        ```
        Write this in your app's js entrypoint (like `main.ts`):
        ```ts
        import Auth from "@authlocal/authlocal"
        import theme from "@authlocal/authlocal/x/themes/e280.css.js"

        const auth = await Auth.install({theme})

        // Handle user logins and logouts
        auth.on(login => {
          if (login) console.log("login", login.label)
          else console.log("logout")
        })
        ```
1. Place the UI elements into your html `<body>`:
    ```html
    <auth-user></auth-user>
    <auth-button></auth-button>
    ```
1. It's ready, take it for a spin!
     - You should now be able to login, and logout

### More about CSS themes
- See that `e280.css.js` theme in the install snippet? You can swap it out!
  - `basic.css.js` ‚Äî simple high-contrast theme
  - `e280.css.js` ‚Äî neon buildercore aesthetic
- You can actually omit the theme, and it will look all browser-defaulty and ugly:
  ```ts
  const auth = await Auth.install()
  ```
- If you must, you can put on your mud boots and write your own custom css like this:
  ```ts
  import {Auth, css} from "@authlocal/authlocal"
  import theme from "@authlocal/authlocal/x/themes/basic.css.js"

  const auth = await Auth.install({theme: css`

    /* You can extend one of the preset themes */
    ${theme}

    /* Just write your own CSS as you wish */
    button { color: red; }
  `})
  ```

### Anatomy of a `login`
- **`login.id` unique id for a user**
  > eg, `"a08263e70a0a48a07e988a7c0931ada6b0a38fa84bf367087b810c614a4c2070"`  
  > *(it's actually the user identity public key)*
- **`login.label` ‚Äî user's chosen nickname**
  > eg, `"Michael Scott"`

## Authlocal claims

#### Okay, so you have a user's `login`. Now what?
- The purpose of a login is to *sign claims* on the user's behalf.
- You must *never* send the login data anywhere. It should stay on the user's clientside device.
- The login is automatically persisted in `localStorage`.

#### The purpose of a claim is to say *"on behalf of this user, my frontend says..."*
- "...they want to post this message"
- "...they want to change their avatar"
- "...they want to buy this microtransaction"

#### Claims are secured cryptographically.
- Claims contain cryptographic proof that they stem from a user's login.
- No attacker can spoof a claim for somebody else's identity.

### Sign a claim
```js
import {future} from "@authlocal/authlocal"

const claimToken = await login.signClaim({

  // any json-friendly data you want
  claim: {message: "i love ice cream"},

  // when should this claim expire?
  expiresAt: future.hours(24),
})
```

### Verify a claim
```js
import {verifyClaim} from "@authlocal/authlocal"

const {claim, proof} = await verifyClaim({
  claimToken,
  appOrigins: ["https://example.e280.org"],
})

proof.sessionId
  // id for this login session, looks like:
  // "ff730fe2d725aa5210152975212d1068d7fe28ae22b5e62337a4cde42215187a"

proof.nametag.id
  // user identity id, looks like:
  // "a08263e70a0a48a07e988a7c0931ada6b0a38fa84bf367087b810c614a4c2070"

proof.nametag.label
  // user identity nickname, looks like:
  // "Michael Scott"
```
- You can verify claims on the clientside or serverside.
- You must specify what `appOrigins` you expect to receive claims from (this prevents phishing attacks).
